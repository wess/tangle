-- Owner-controlled toggles for instance-wide features (MCP HTTP endpoint
-- and whatever else gets gated later). Plain key/value rows; values are
-- JSON-encoded strings so booleans, numbers, and tiny objects all fit.
-- Default state is "absent" → feature off. The admin UI inserts a row to
-- turn a feature on and updates it to turn it off again; we never delete.
